# Siva Builds

**Business leader. CS background. Going all-in on AI.**

I'm Siva — Country Head at Hunter Douglas India, managing a 30-person operations team. After 14+ years in leadership roles at AB InBev, Diageo, and Nike, I'm now building AI systems to solve the real operational problems I've lived through.

This isn't about chasing trends. It's about applying AI where it actually moves the needle — in a business that makes physical products, manages dealer networks, and runs on human coordination.
