      "Cascade logic is the hardest part of any multi-stage ops system. The edge cases (rework purchases re-entering the GRN flow, partial installations needing re-scheduling) require explicit design, not just handling.",
      "Action-bucket UI is significantly more useful than a status list. 'Show me orders where I need to do something' beats 'show me all orders sorted by status'.",
      "Supabase RLS + role-based routing is a clean pattern for this kind of system. Each role's dashboard query is already scoped \u2014 no accidental data exposure.",
      "12 sprints of 15 tasks each is a surprisingly effective cadence for a system this complex. Small, shippable increments that each add a real workflow."
