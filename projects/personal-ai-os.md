# Project: Personal AI Operating System

**Status:** Active — Phase 1 complete  
**Started:** Feb 28, 2026

## The problem
Running a 30-person business while building AI systems on the side means context-switching constantly. Information gets lost between sessions. Research takes too long. The same questions get asked repeatedly.

## The goal
A system that:
- Remembers decisions and context across sessions
- Handles research and information gathering autonomously
- Surfaces the right information before I ask for it
- Gets smarter the longer I use it

## What's built (Phase 1)
- [x] Multi-agent stack (BarleyBot + Coffee + Coder)
- [x] 3-layer memory system
- [x] Daily podcast digest (81 feeds)
- [x] Daily RSS digest (13 feeds)
- [x] Deep research skill for Coffee
- [x] Public knowledge base (this repo)

## What's next (Phase 2)
- [ ] Publishing pipeline — auto-draft LinkedIn posts from daily learnings
- [ ] Connect to Hunter Douglas ops data
- [ ] HR automation integration
- [ ] Spice Lab research automation

## Learnings log
- **Feb 28** — Foundation built. Memory architecture is the most important layer to get right first.
