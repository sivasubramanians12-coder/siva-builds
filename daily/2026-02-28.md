# 2026-02-28 — Day 1: BarleyBot Goes Live + HDPipeline Deployed

## What Was Built

### BarleyBot (OpenClaw Personal Assistant)
- First boot today. Named after Barley (the dog). OpenClaw configured end-to-end on Mac mini.
- Telegram bot live (@BarleyMisoBot) — DM pairing approved, routing working
- Sub-agents configured: **coffee** (research) and **coder** (Claude Opus 4.6, builds)
- Heartbeats active: hourly Telegram health + memory writes
- SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md — all identity/context files written
- Gateway running as LaunchAgent for stability

### HDPipeline — Order Operations Tracker
Massive deployment day: 19 commits, full stack shipped to Railway.
- **Backend (FastAPI):** Auth fixed — Supabase service_role JWT support, port aligned to Railway (8080), Docker build fixed (pip over uv)
- **Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind v4):** Build pipeline cleaned — removed stale PostCSS config, excluded test files from Docker, fixed envsubst for nginx
- **Nginx:** Solved Railway DNS resolver issue — then simplified entirely by dropping nginx proxy, calling backend directly via VITE_API_URL
- **Telegram Bot:** All handlers registered — /link, /newproject, /update, /mystats, /summary with ConversationHandlers for multi-step flows
- **Data model:** Fixed column mismatches in seed script + migration chain

## Tools Used
- Claude Code (coder sub-agent) — all HDPipeline commits co-authored
- OpenClaw — orchestration, Telegram routing, heartbeat scheduling
- Railway — Docker-based deployment platform
- Supabase — auth + database
- FastAPI, React, Vite, Tailwind v4, nginx

## Key Learnings
1. Railway doesn't use Docker's 127.0.0.11 DNS resolver — read /etc/resolv.conf at startup, or skip proxy entirely
2. uv sync in Docker is unreliable in constrained envs — plain pip install works
3. nginx envsubst replaces ALL variables including nginx's own ($host, $uri) — pass explicit list
4. Tailwind v4 with @tailwindcss/vite needs no PostCSS config — old configs cause silent failures
5. BarleyBot memory architecture: daily files (raw log) → MEMORY.md (curated wisdom)

## What's Next
- HDPipeline: End-to-end test with real order data; validate Telegram bot flows
- Baseline order cycle time before targeting 17 → 14 days
- hd-hire: HR automation — not started yet
- QMD memory backend: resolve bun/node conflict and re-enable
- LinkedIn: Start publishing — every build is a post
