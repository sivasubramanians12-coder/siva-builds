# Feb 28, 2026 — Day 1: Building My AI Operating System

## What I built today

Set up a personal AI agent stack from scratch using OpenClaw on my Mac mini. This is the foundation layer — the infrastructure I'll use to automate research, coding, and knowledge management across my work.

### Agents configured
- **BarleyBot (main)** — My primary AI assistant. Lives in Telegram DM. Handles ops, memory, orchestration
- **Coffee** — Research agent bound to a dedicated research Telegram group. Runs deep multi-source research on any topic, saves outputs to a knowledge base
- **Coder** — Coding agent (Claude Opus) for building and shipping features

### Key systems working
- **3-layer memory system** — Active context → daily logs → long-term curated memory. The agent wakes up every session and "remembers" context from previous days
- **Podcast Digest** — Daily cron at 8 AM IST. Scans 81 podcast feeds, surfaces new episodes with smart picks based on my interests
- **RSS Digest** — Scans 13 RSS feeds daily for relevant articles
- **Deep research skill** — Coffee can now do structured multi-source research on any topic, saving full reports to a local knowledge base

### What I learned
1. Agent configuration is mostly JSON — once you understand the schema, it's fast to iterate
2. Model routing matters: different agents need different models. Research ≠ coding ≠ orchestration
3. Memory architecture is the most underrated part of agent systems. Without it, every session starts from zero — useless for ongoing work
4. Binding agents to specific Telegram groups is a clean UX pattern — the right agent shows up in the right context

### What didn't work (and why)
- Gemini API (free tier) rate limits instantly on the first call — not viable for subagents
- Direct JSON editing breaks configs. Python scripting for config changes is safer
- Gateway restart always throws a cosmetic error in active sessions — not a real failure, just confusing

### Tomorrow
- Test Coffee's deep research skill with a real business question
- Start logging HD India Ops OS decisions here
- Set up the publishing pipeline (auto-draft LinkedIn posts from daily logs)
