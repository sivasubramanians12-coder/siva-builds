# 2026-03-01 — Daily Build Log

## What was built today

### NewCoachOS — Wave 3 complete

Two major sprints shipped today on NewCoachOS, a coaching management platform built with multi-agent orchestration (Conductor + Claude Opus).

#### v5-dashboard — CRM Views & Client Management
- Client list with sortable table, search/filter, pagination (20/page)
- Client detail page: profile cards, session history, commitment tracker
- Client create/edit forms with Zod-validated Server Actions
- At-risk badge system + live dashboard stats
- **171 tests passing**, tsc clean, eslint 0 warnings

#### v6-knowledge — pgvector RAG System (Knowledge Brain)
Full semantic search + knowledge ingestion pipeline:
- pgvector HNSW index + match_knowledge_chunks SQL function
- Obsidian markdown parser with heading-based chunking
- OpenAI embedding generation → ingest → cosine similarity search
- REST API: POST /api/knowledge/search + /api/knowledge/ingest
- Metadata filtering (domain, content_type, leadership_stage)
- Cohere Rerank post-processing
- **10/10 tasks complete**, all tier-1 tests passing

## Tools used
- Next.js 16, Supabase, pgvector, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- OpenAI Embeddings API, Cohere Rerank API
- Vitest, TypeScript strict mode
- Conductor (multi-agent orchestration), Claude Opus 4.6

## Key learnings
- pgvector HNSW indexes faster than IVFFlat for real-time search at this scale
- Cohere Rerank meaningfully improves result quality over raw cosine similarity
- Heading-based chunking from Obsidian preserves semantic context better than fixed-size chunking
- Conductor wave/sprint model works well for parallelising complex features — Wave 3 (v5 + v6) both landed clean

## What's next
- Wave 4: v7-session-engine + v8-companion (can run parallel)
- Wave 5: v9-integrations (calendar, email, Zapier)
- Gateway LaunchAgent config fix pending
